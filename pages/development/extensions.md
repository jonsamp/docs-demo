Extensions allow you to extend your development client with additional capabilities.

## Extending the dev menu

The dev menu can be extended to include extra buttons by using the `registerDevMenuItems` API:

```tsx
import { registerDevMenuItems } from 'expo-dev-menu';

const devMenuItems = [
  {
    name: 'My Custom Button',
    callback: () => console.log("Hello world!")
  }
];

registerDevMenuItems(devMenuItems);
```

This will create a new section in the dev menu that includes the buttons you have registered: 

<ImageSpotlight
  alt="An example of a custom menu button in expo-dev-menu"
  src="/static/images/dev-client/custom-menu-button.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}
/>

> Note: Subsequent calls of `registerDevMenuItems` will override all previous entries.

## EAS Updates

<ImageSpotlight 
  alt="An example list of EAS Updates that can be loaded in the expo-dev-client"
  src="/static/images/dev-client/eas-updates-screen.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: 600 }}
/>

The EAS Updates extension provides the ability to view and load published updates in your development client.

It's now available for all development clients `v0.9.0` and above. In order to install it, you'll need the most recent publish of expo updates from npm:

<Terminal cmd={['$ expo install expo-dev-client expo-updates']} />

### Configure EAS Update

If you have not yet configured EAS Updates in your project, you can find [additional instructions on how to do so here.](/eas-update/getting-started/)

That's it! You can now view and load EAS Updates in your development build via the `Extensions` panel.
